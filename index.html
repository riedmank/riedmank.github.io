      <h2 class="main__header">General</h2>
      <p class="main__text">
        Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated
        the concept of a digital programmable computer. </p>

      <p class="main__text">
        Considered by some to be a "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that
        eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found
        in Babbage's analytical engine. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among
        the many polymaths of his century.</p>

      <p class="main__text"> Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference
        engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success
        of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.

      <h2 class="main__header">Interesting facts:</h2>
      <ul class="main__list">
        <li class="list__element">At one of the schools he attended, Babbage was allowed access to a library that spurred on his love of math.</li>
        <li class="list__element">After finishing his early education, Babbage was accepted to Cambridge's Trinity College where he was disappointed
          in their math department.</li>
        <li class="list__element">This caused him to form the Analytical Society in 1812, along with several other friends and fellow students, with
          the purpose of working deeper in mathematics.</li>
        <li class="list__element">He was also a part of two other clubs, the Ghost Club which studied paranormal phenomena, and the Extractors Club,
          whose sole purpose was to make sure its members were freed from mental institutions of they were committed due
          to their work.</li>
        <li class="list__element">After being denied a diploma with top honors for a thesis that was considered blasphemous, Babbage set about correcting
          his reputation through his work.</li>
        <li class="list__element">He lectured the Royal Institution and was made a member of the Royal Society the following year.</li>
        <li class="list__element">Despite this, he still had trouble finding positions, even though he applied many places.</li>
        <li class="list__element">Unable to find positions, Babbage went to work with a fellow researcher, John Herschel, on the concept behind the
          electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, work which they published together in 1825.</li>
        <li class="list__element">This work is the underlying principle behind eddy currents.</li>
        <li class="list__element">He briefly worked in setting up actuarial tables for insurance companies, but didn't pursue a career there.</li>
        <li class="list__element">Babbage struggled financially until his father's death, when he inherited a large sum of the estate; his wife died
          in the same year, and Babbage began to travel extensively.</li>
        <li class="list__element">While he was traveling abroad, he learned that he had been accepted to a position to teach at Cambridge.</li>
        <li class="list__element">While at Cambridge, he helped found the Astronomical Society in 1820 and brought more purpose to the original Analytical
          Society that he'd helped form as a student.</li>
        <li class="list__element">One of the chief purposes of the new effort was to create a French-to-English translation of a groundbreaking new
          calculus text.
        </li>
        <li class="list__element">Throughout the years, Babbage and Herschel dabbled with a project known as the "difference engine," which laid the
          groundwork for a programmable computer.</li>
        <li class="list__element">The work he conducted on this device and its resulting follow-up prototypes led to the establishment of the revolutionary
          Babbage principle, which demonstrated the advantage to having division of labor in industry.</li>
        <li class="list__element">A fully working prototype of another Babbage difference engine was built in 1991, based off of the detailed plans
          that Babbage left behind.</li>
